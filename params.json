{"name":"Localizedpadavan","tagline":"async jQuery localization with cookie","body":"localizedPadavan v0.4\r\n\r\nThis is for async language localization.\r\n\r\n- It uses rel property of html elements. \r\n- Reads & writes on json \r\n- On language change, language name stored on cookie so you can cache your json file with no problem.\r\n- You can give a cookie name to store your cookie or script will use default.\r\n- It'll have a stable admin interface on php (first), python, asp, ruby for you to implement easily but not right now.\r\nActualy it's not hard to save & edit a json file with simple key value state. \r\n\r\nMay be i can right a memcached or redis handler to read directly from cache but let's forget about it right now. \r\nCause i'm a bit lazy so; \r\n\r\nYou can find sample usage in langControl.php\r\n```javascript\r\n<script type='text/javascript' src='js/jquery-1.7.2.min.js'></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/localizedPadavan.0.8.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n\t$(document).ready(function(){\r\n        \tvar nowLang = $(document).cookieControl({ key:'langVal' });\r\n\t\t$(document).localizedPadavan({ changeLang:nowLang ,langUL: 'langList',cookieName: 'langVal' }); \r\n\t});\r\n</script> \r\n\r\n<span rel=\"_main_Title\"></span>\r\n```\r\nBeware of using on production right now! It's just a test and i'm working on it.\r\n\r\nWell, still ongoing project and not  finished so do not complain till version 1.0... \r\nAnd I appreciate any comment from you so send a comment i'll try to fix it.","google":"UA-35777695-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
