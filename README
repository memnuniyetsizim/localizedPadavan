localizedPadavan v0.4

This is for async language localization.

- It uses rel property of html elements. 
- Reads & writes on json 
- On language change, language name stored on cookie so you can cache your json file with no problem.
- You can give a cookie name to store your cookie or script will use default.
- It'll have a stable admin interface on php (first), python, asp, ruby for you to implement easily but not right now.
Actualy it's not hard to save & edit a json file with simple key value state. 

May be i can right a memcached or redis handler to read directly from cache but let's forget about it right now. 
Cause i'm a bit lazy so; 

You can find sample usage in langControl.php

<script type='text/javascript' src='js/jquery-1.7.2.min.js'></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/localizedPadavan.0.8.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
	$(document).ready(function(){
        	var nowLang = $(document).cookieControl({ key:'langVal' });
		$(document).localizedPadavan({ changeLang:nowLang ,langUL: 'langList',cookieName: 'langVal' }); 
	});
</script> 

<span rel="_main_Title"></span>

Beware of using on production right now! It's just a test and i'm working on it.

Well, still ongoing project and not  finished so do not complain till version 1.0... 
And I appreciate any comment from you so send a comment i'll try to fix it.
